Apache Linkis is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,communications, and decision-making
process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.While
incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating project’s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF policy.
For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing conditions.
What follows is a list of issues the project is currently aware of (this list is likely to be incomplete):

1. Releases may have incomplete licensing conditions

2. Some svg/image/woff files:
         web/src/components/svgIcon/svg/*.svg
         web/src/dss/assets/projectIconFont/iconfont.svg
         web/src/dss/assets/projectIconFont/iconfont.eot
         web/src/dss/assets/projectIconFont/iconfont.woff
         web/src/dss/assets/projectIconFont/iconfont.woff2
   in the web component may not licensed, We need to confirm these files one by one. For unlicensed files,
   we will remove them or getting approvals from other copyright holders in subsequent versions.

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project,please be aware that
